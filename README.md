# snkit - a spatial networks toolkit

/ˈsnɪkɪt/ – sounds like [snicket](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/snicket) (noun,
Northern English) A narrow passage between houses; an alleyway.

## Why use snkit?

`snkit` helps tidy spatial network data.

Say you have some edges and nodes (lines and points, connections and vertices). None of them
are quite connected, and there's no explicit data to define which node is at the end of which
edge, or which edges are connected.

For example:

![Unconnected network](docs/source/_static/unconnected-network.png)

`snkit` has methods to:

- add endpoints to each edge
- connect nodes to nearest edges
- split edges at connecting points
- create node and edge ids, and add from_id and to_id to each edge

### Spatial network

The output of a snkit data cleaning process might look something like this:

![Connected network](docs/source/_static/connected-network.png)

#### Nodes

| geometry            | id     | other attributes... |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| `POINT (0.03 0.04)` | node_0 | ...                 |
| `POINT (0.03 0.03)` | node_1 | ...                 |
| `POINT (0.02 0.03)` | node_2 | ...                 |

#### Edges

| geometry                    | id     | from_id | to_id   | other attributes... |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| `LINESTRING (0.04 -0.04...` | edge_0 | node_10 | node_22 | ...                 |
| `LINESTRING (0.01 -0.03...` | edge_1 | node_22 | node_21 | ...                 |
| `LINESTRING (0.02 -0.02...` | edge_2 | node_21 | node_25 | ...                 |

## Getting started

Install system libraries (only tested on Ubuntu):

    sudo apt-get install -y libgeos-dev gdal-bin

Or use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to install major dependencies:

    conda install geopandas shapely

Install or upgrade `snkit` using pip:

    pip install --upgrade snkit

See the [demo
notebook](https://github.com/tomalrussell/snkit/blob/master/notebooks/snkit-demo.ipynb) for a
small demonstration.

## Development

Clone this repository:

    git clone git@github.com:tomalrussell/snkit.git

Maybe set up a virtualenv or conda environment, as you wish. Then install `snkit` in editable
mode, with development packages:

    pip install -e .[dev]

Run the tests:

    python -m pytest tests/

## Testimonials 💯 👍 😊
