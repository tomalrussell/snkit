# Contributing to `snkit`

🎉👍 First of all, thank you for considering contributing to `snkit`!

Second, a note of caution.. The project is currently in an early stage 
of development - things might change significantly and code is liable 
to move around as we scope out what `snkit` should do.


## Getting started

Please add a new [issue](https://github.com/tomalrussell/snkit/issues) if you
would like to suggest a feature, or if you may have found a bug.

Pull requests are welcome, but in general please do discuss the change in an 
issue first.

See the project [code of conduct](https://github.com/tomalrussell/snkit/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
