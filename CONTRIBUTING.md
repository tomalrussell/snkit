# Contributing to `snkit`

🎉👍 First of all, thank you for considering contributing to `snkit`!

Second, a note of caution.. The project is currently in an early stage
of development - things might change significantly and code is liable
to move around as we scope out what `snkit` should do.


## Getting started

Pull requests are welcome, but in general please do discuss the change in an
issue first.
